# Deploying Your Own Organisation

This guide explains how to deploy your own organisation using the Powers protocol. While there are no no-code solutions yet, we have simplified the process through a frontend interface and deployment scripts.

## 1. General Logic

The fundamental deployment logic is the same whether you use the frontend or smart contract scripts. It follows a three-step process:

::::steps

#### Deploy a vanilla `Powers.sol` contract
This is the core contract for your organisation, initialized with basic metadata like its name and URI.

#### Deploy Dependencies 
Any dependency smart contracts (like a treasury) are deployed.

#### Configure Mandates and Dependencies 
The initial set of mandates for your organisation are configured with the addresses of these dependencies.

#### Constitute the Organisation
The `constitute` function on your `Powers.sol` contract is called with the mandate configurations. This function initializes all the mandates, officially establishing the governance structure of your organisation.

::::

This sequence ensures that the core contract is set up first, followed by its specific rules and extensions, and is finally activated in a single, atomic transaction.

## 2. Frontend Deployment

The simplest way to deploy an organisation is through the Powers frontend. The entire logic for an organisation's deployment is encapsulated in a single TypeScript file located in the `frontend/organisations/` directory.

Good examples to study are `Powers101.ts` (a simple DAO) and `PowerLabs.ts` (a more complex organisation for protocol funding).

### The Organisation File Structure

Each organisation file defines an `Organization` object with several key properties:

-   `metadata`: Contains information like the organisation's `id`, `title`, `description`, and banner image URI.
-   `fields`: An array defining input fields that will be rendered on the deployment page. This allows for user-configurable parameters, such as a Chainlink Subscription ID in `PowerLabs.ts`.
-   `dependencies`: An array of other smart contracts that need to be deployed before the organisation can be constituted. For example, `PowerLabs.ts` depends on a `Treasury` contract.
-   `allowedChains`: An array of chain IDs where the organisation can be deployed.
-   `createMandateInitData`: This is the core function. It takes the addresses of the newly deployed `Powers` contract and its dependencies, along with any user input from the `fields`, and returns the structured data needed to call the `constitute` function.

### Create your .ts file 

Using the provided examples, you can create your own organisation file by defining its metadata, required fields, dependencies, and the logic for initializing its mandates.

::::steps

#### Copy an Example
Start by copying an existing organisation file like `Powers101.ts` or `PowerLabs.ts` into a new file in the `frontend/organisations/` directory.

#### Define Metadata and Fields
Update the `metadata` property with your organisation's details. Define any input fields needed for configuration. 

#### Check existing Mandates
The `powered` folder contains json files for chains and the reusable `Mandate.sol` contracts that are deployed on them. Identify which mandates you want to include in your organisation. 

The `solidity/src/mandates/` folder contains the source code for these mandates.

#### Define Dependencies
If your organisation requires additional contracts (like a treasury), define them in the `dependencies` array.

#### Create your own custom createMandateInitData function
This function should prepare and return the `MandateInitData` array, linking each mandate contract to its configuration based on the deployed addresses and any user input. 

#### Add the organisation to the Frontend
Finally, register your new organisation file in the frontend's organisation list so it appears on the deploy a demo page.
This is done by adding it to the 'organizations' array in `frontend/organisations/index.ts`.

#### Deploy via the Frontend
Once your organisation file is set up and registered, you can deploy it through the Powers frontend interface.

## 3. Smart Contract Deployment

For developers who prefer a programmatic approach, organisations can be deployed using smart contract scripts with a framework like Foundry. The `solidity/script/DeployTestOrgs.s.sol` script provides a clear example of this process.

### The Scripting Logic

The script follows the same fundamental logic as the frontend:

::::steps

#### Deploy Dependencies
The script first deploys any necessary mock contracts or dependencies. In `DeployTestOrgs.s.sol`, this is handled by `InitialiseHelpers.s.sol`.

#### Deploy Mandate Contracts
It deploys the individual `Mandate` contracts that will be used by the organisation. This is handled by `InitialisePowers.s.sol`.

#### Deploy Powers Contract
A new, unconfigured `Powers.sol` contract is deployed.

#### Prepare Constitution Data
A helper contract or function (like `TestConstitutions.sol` in the example) is used to generate the `MandateInitData` array, linking the mandate contracts to their configurations.

#### Constitute the Organisation
The `constitute` function on the `Powers` contract is called with the prepared `mandateInitData`.

::::

This method offers more control and is ideal for automated testing, complex setups, or integrating Powers deployment into a larger scripted workflow. By examining the test and script files in the `solidity/` directory, you can build a robust deployment script for your own custom organisation.
