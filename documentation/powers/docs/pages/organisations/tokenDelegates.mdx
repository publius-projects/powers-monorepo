# Token Delegates Specification

**Latest deployments:** 

| Network | Deployment |
| :---- | :---- |
| - | - |

## **Organisational Structure & Context**

### ***Vision & Mission***

Token Delegates DAO uses a token-weighted governance system where Delegates are elected based on the backing they receive from token holders. It demonstrates how ERC20 tokens can be integrated into the Powers protocol to determine leadership roles.

### ***Assets*** 

The DAO controls the following assets:

*   It does not have a treasury, but can manage external assets through governance actions.
*   It utilizes a voting token (SimpleErc20Votes) for determining delegate support.

### ***Actions*** 

The DAO can take the following actions:

*   **Voters** can nominate themselves for leadership.
*   **The Public** (anyone) can trigger the election process which updates the Delegate set based on token delegation.
*   **Delegates** have the power to revoke roles.
*   **Admin** can assign roles to any account.

### ***Roles***

<div class="table-roles">
| Role Id | Role name | Selection criteria |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Admin | Assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Voters | Assigned by Admin. |
| 2 | Delegates | Elected by Token Delegation. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div>

### ***Electoral Mandates***

#### Nomination

Voters can nominate themselves for the Delegate role. Only those who nominate themselves can be elected.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Voters | Nominate for Delegates | Nominate.sol | None | Nomination logged | None. |
</div>

#### Elect Delegates

This mandate processes the election results. It checks the token delegation for all nominees and assigns the Delegate role to the top candidates.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Public | Elect Delegates | DelegateTokenSelect.sol | None | Updates Delegate roles based on token weight | Throttled (once every ~10 minutes). Top 3 nominees elected. |
</div>

### ***Reform Mandates***

#### Role Management

The Admin has the power to assign roles. As a check on this power, Delegates can revoke roles that have been assigned.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Admin | Admin assign role | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "uint256 roleId, address account" | Assigns role | None. |
| Delegates | Delegate revoke role | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "uint256 roleId, address account" | Revokes role | Requires "Admin assign role" to be fulfilled. |
</div>

## Description of Governance

*   **Remit**: To select Delegates based on token stakeholder support.
*   **Roles**: Delegates are determined by token weight.
*   **Executive Paths**:
    *   **Election Cycle**: Nominate -> Token Holders Delegate -> Trigger Election Update.

## Risk Assessment

### Token Concentration
Large token holders (whales) can dominate the election of Delegates.

### Vote Buying
Token-based voting is susceptible to bribery and vote buying.
