## **Organisational Structure & Context**

### ***Vision & Mission***

Powers 101 is a simple DAO designed to demonstrate the core concepts of the Powers protocol. It provides a basic governance structure with a separation of powers between delegates, members, and an admin, making it an ideal starting point for understanding how the protocol works.

### ***Treasury Management***

The organization does not have a treasury assigned. 

## **Powers 101**

### ***Mission***

To provide a simple, transparent, and educational platform for users to learn about decentralized governance.

### ***Assets*** 

Powers 101 controls the following assets:

*   It utilizes an ERC20 token for delegate elections.

### ***Actions*** 

Powers 101 can take the following actions:

*   Members can propose actions.
*   The Admin can veto actions.
*   Delegates can execute actions.
*   The Public can nominate themselves and participate in delegate elections via token delegation.

### ***Roles***

<div class="table-roles">
| Role Id | Role name | Selection criteria |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Admin | Assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Members | Assigned by Admin. |
| 2 | Delegates | Elected by Token Holders. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div>

### ***Executive Mandates***

#### Action Lifecycle

The governance process follows a cycle where Members propose actions, the Admin has the power to veto them, and Delegates execute the approved proposals.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Members | Propose Action | StatementOfIntent.sol | "address[] Targets, uint256[] Values, bytes[] Calldatas" | none | 66% success, 20% quorum, 5 minute voting period |
| Admin | Veto Action | StatementOfIntent.sol | (same as above) | none | Proposal must exist. |
| Delegates | Execute Action | OpenAction.sol | (same as above) | Executes the proposed action | 66% success, 20% quorum, 5 minute voting period, proposal must exist, not vetoed |
</div>

### ***Electoral Mandates***

#### Delegate Election

Delegates are elected based on the amount of tokens delegated to them.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Public | Nominate Me | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "bool NominateMe" | Nomination logged | None. |
| Public | Delegate Nominees | ElectionList_Tally.sol | None | Elects top 3 nominees to Delegate role | None. |
</div>

### ***Reform Mandates***

There are no specific constitutional mandates defined in the Powers 101 organization. Mandate management is handled by the Admin role.
 
## Description of Governance

Powers 101 is a decentralized organization designed to showcase the fundamental governance principles of the Powers protocol.

* **Remit**: The primary function is to provide a simple, transparent, and educational platform for users to learn about decentralized governance.
* **Roles**: Roles are straightforward: **Members** propose, **Delegates** execute, and an **Admin** role manages the system.
* **Executive Paths**:
  * **Proposal Lifecycle**: Members propose actions, the Admin can veto them, and Delegates execute approved proposals.
* **Summary**: The governance structure of Powers 101 is a minimalist implementation of the Powers protocol, demonstrating a clear separation of powers.

## Risk Assessment 

### No checks on role assignment
Note that for demonstration purposes, there are no checks on allocation of roles in the initial deployment (except via Admin).
