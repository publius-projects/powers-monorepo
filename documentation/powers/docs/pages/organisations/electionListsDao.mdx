# Open Elections Specification

**Latest deployments:** 

| Network | Deployment |
| :---- | :---- |
| - | - |

## **Organisational Structure & Context**

### ***Vision & Mission***

Open Elections DAO demonstrates a governance model focused on the democratic election of Delegates by Voters. It implements a full on-chain election lifecycle including creation, nomination, voting, and tallying, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process for selecting representatives.

### ***Assets*** 

The DAO controls the following assets:

*   It is the owner of the treasury (implicit in the Powers contract).

### ***Actions*** 

The DAO can take the following actions:

*   **Voters** can create elections, nominate themselves, vote, and tally results.
*   **Delegates** are elected by Voters and have the power to revoke roles (check on power).
*   **Admin** can assign roles to any account.

### ***Roles***

<div class="table-roles">
| Role Id | Role name | Selection criteria |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Admin | Assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Voters | Assigned by Admin. |
| 2 | Delegates | Elected by Voters. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div>

### ***Electoral Mandates***

#### Election Cycle

The election process follows a strict sequence: creating the election, opening it for voting, tallying the results, and finally cleaning up the governance artifacts.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Voters | Create election | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "string Title, uint48 StartBlock, uint48 EndBlock" | Creates election entry | Throttled (once every ~2 hours). |
| Voters | Open Vote for election | ElectionList_CreateVoteMandate.sol | None | Creates Vote Mandate | Requires "Create election" to be fulfilled. |
| Voters | Tally elections | ElectionList_Tally.sol | None | Assigns Delegate role to winners | Requires "Open Vote for election" to be fulfilled. Top 5 candidates elected. |
| Voters | Clean up election | BespokeAction_OnReturnValue.sol | None | Revokes election mandates | Requires "Tally elections" to be fulfilled. |
</div>

#### Nomination

Voters can nominate themselves (or revoke nomination) for an upcoming election.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Voters | Nominate for election | ElectionList_Nominate.sol | None (implicit bool true) | Nomination logged | None. |
| Voters | Revoke nomination | ElectionList_Nominate.sol | None (implicit bool false) | Nomination revoked | None. |
</div>

### ***Reform Mandates***

#### Role Management

The Admin has the power to assign roles. As a check on this power, Delegates can revoke roles that have been assigned.

<div class="table-mandates">
| Role | Name & Description | Base contract | User Input | Executable Output | Conditions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Admin | Admin assign role | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "uint256 roleId, address account" | Assigns role | None. |
| Delegates | Delegate revoke role | BespokeAction_Simple.sol | "uint256 roleId, address account" | Revokes role | Requires "Admin assign role" to be fulfilled. |
</div>

## Off-chain Operations

### ***Dispute Resolution***

Disputes regarding election conduct or results will be addressed through community discussion, with final arbitration by the Admin role.

### ***Code of Conduct***

Voters and Delegates are expected to participate honestly. Campaigning should be respectful and transparent.

## Description of Governance

*   **Remit**: To select Delegates through a fair election process.
*   **Roles**: Voters elect Delegates.
*   **Executive Paths**:
    *   **Election Cycle**: Create -> Nominate -> Vote -> Tally -> Assign Role.

## Risk Assessment

### Voter Turnout
Low voter turnout could lead to unrepresentative Delegates.

### Sybil Attacks
If the mechanism for assigning the Voter role is not secure, one person could control multiple Voter accounts.
