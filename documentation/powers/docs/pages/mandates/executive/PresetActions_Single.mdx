# PresetActions_Single

PresetActions_Single is an executive mandate that executes a predefined set of actions unconditionally.

## Overview

This mandate acts as a trigger for a specific, hardcoded sequence of events. When executed, it sends a pre-configured set of calls to pre-configured targets. This is ideal for routine maintenance tasks, standard operating procedures, or any action where the details are fixed and only the authorization to proceed is needed.

## Configuration

When adopting a PresetActions_Single instance, the following parameters are required:

1.  `targets` (address[]): An array of target contracts to call.
2.  `values` (uint256[]): An array of ETH values to send.
3.  `calldatas` (bytes[]): An array of encoded function calls.

All arrays must be of equal length.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

This mandate does not require any input parameters. When called, it unconditionally executes the configured actions.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Retrieval**
    *   Retrieves the stored `targets`, `values`, and `calldatas` from the configuration.

2.  **Execution**
    *   Returns the batch of calls directly to the Powers contract for execution.
