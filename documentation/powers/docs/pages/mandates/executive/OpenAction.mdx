# OpenAction

OpenAction is an executive mandate that enables the execution of arbitrary function calls to any contract.

## Overview

This mandate provides the highest level of flexibility. It allows a proposal to execute any sequence of actions: multiple calls to multiple contracts, sending ETH, etc. It essentially exposes the full execution capability of the Powers contract to whatever role controls this mandate.

**Warning:** Because it is unrestricted, this mandate should be granted only to highly trusted roles or governance processes (e.g., a DAO vote). If granted to a public or untrusted role, it compromises the entire protocol.

## Configuration

When adopting an OpenAction instance, no configuration parameters are required.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, three array parameters must be provided:

1.  `targets` (address[]): An array of target contract addresses to call.
2.  `values` (uint256[]): An array of ETH values (in wei) to send with each call.
3.  `calldatas` (bytes[]): An array of encoded function call data for each target.

All three arrays must have the same length.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Pass-through**
    *   The mandate simply takes the decoded arrays and returns them directly to the Powers contract for execution.
    *   No validation or modification of the payload occurs.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(...) public override
```
-   Sets input parameters to `(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas)`.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public pure override returns (...)
```
-   Decodes and returns the input arrays.
