# StatementOfIntent

StatementOfIntent is an executive mandate that allows a role to record a proposal or statement on-chain without triggering any execution logic.

## Overview

This mandate serves as a signaling mechanism. It allows a governance body or role to formalize an intent, make a declaration, or pass a "soft vote" where the outcome is recorded in the Powers protocol history but no contract calls are made. It can be used for:
*   Ratifying off-chain decisions.
*   Signaling agreement on a strategy.
*   Publishing a statement or manifesto.

## Configuration

When adopting a StatementOfIntent instance, the following parameter is required:

1.  `inputParams` (string[]): An array of strings describing the data fields that the statement should contain (e.g., `["string Title", "string Content"]`). This guides the UI on what inputs to request from the proposer.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, the input (`mandateCalldata`) should contain the encoded values corresponding to the configured `inputParams`. These values are stored in the action history.

### Execution Flow

1.  **No-Op**
    *   The mandate receives the input but intentionally does not generate any execution calls.
    *   It returns empty arrays (`targets`, `values`, `calldatas`), signifying a successful "execution" that results in no state changes beyond the recording of the action itself.

## Technical Specifications
