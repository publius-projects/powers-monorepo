# PresetActions_OnOwnPowers

PresetActions_OnOwnPowers is an executive mandate that executes a predefined set of actions on the Powers contract itself.

## Overview

This mandate is similar to `PresetActions_Single`, but the target of the execution is hardcoded to `address(this)` (the Powers contract). This is used for "canned" administrative actions, such as a one-click button to update a specific configuration or enable a specific module on the Powers protocol.

## Configuration

When adopting a PresetActions_OnOwnPowers instance, the following parameter is required:

1.  `callDatas` (bytes[]): An array of encoded function calls to be executed on the Powers contract.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

This mandate does not require any input parameters. When called, it unconditionally executes the configured actions.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Assembly**
    *   Iterates through the configured `callDatas`.
    *   Constructs an execution request where the `target` for every call is the Powers contract address.

2.  **Execution**
    *   Returns the batch of calls for execution.

## Technical Specifications
