# Mandates_Adopt

Mandates_Adopt is an executive mandate designed to streamline the "Reform" process. It allows for the bulk adoption of multiple new mandates in a single action.

## Overview

This mandate simplifies governance upgrades by allowing a single proposal to install multiple new mandates simultaneously. It enforces a standard configuration for these adoptions:
*   All adopted mandates are given the name "Reform mandate".
*   All adopted mandates are initialized with empty configuration bytes.
*   Each adopted mandate is assigned a specific `allowedRole` (access control) defined in the input.

This is particularly useful for upgrading a set of governance capabilities or installing a new module of functionality.

## Configuration

When adopting a Mandates_Adopt instance, no configuration parameters are required.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, two parameters must be provided:

1.  `mandateAddress` (address[]): An array of addresses for the new mandate contracts to be adopted.
2.  `roleIds` (uint256[]): An array of role IDs. `roleIds[i]` specifies the role that will be allowed to call the mandate at `mandateAddress[i]`.

The arrays must be of equal length.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Iterative Construction**
    *   Iterates through the provided arrays.
    *   For each entry, constructs the `MandateInitData` struct:
        *   Sets the name to "Reform mandate".
        *   Sets the target contract to the provided address.
        *   Sets the configuration to empty bytes.
        *   Sets the `allowedRole` condition to the provided role ID.

2.  **Execution**
    *   Generates a call to `IPowers.adoptMandate` for each constructed item.
    *   Returns the batch of adoption calls for execution.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(...) public override
```
-   Sets input parameters to `(address[] mandateAddress, uint256[] roleIds)`.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public pure override returns (...)
```
-   Encodes the batch `adoptMandate` logic.
