# Nominate

Nominate is an electoral mandate that allows users to self-nominate (or revoke their nomination) for an election managed by a `Nominees` contract.

## Overview

This mandate provides a simple interface for users to signal their intent to run for a role or position. It interacts with a helper `Nominees` contract which maintains the list of active candidates. This list is often used by other mandates (like `DelegateTokenSelect` or `ElectionList_Vote`) to conduct elections.

## Configuration

When adopting a Nominate instance, the following parameter is required:

1.  `NomineesContract` (address): The address of the Nominees helper contract where nominations are stored.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, one parameter must be provided:

1.  `shouldNominate` (bool):
    *   `true`: Add the caller to the list of nominees.
    *   `false`: Remove the caller from the list of nominees.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Request Handling**
    *   Decodes the `shouldNominate` boolean.
    *   Prepares a call to the `NomineesContract`.

2.  **External Call**
    *   Executes `nominate(address candidate, bool status)` on the Nominees contract.
    *   Passes the `caller`'s address as the candidate and the `shouldNominate` value as the status.
