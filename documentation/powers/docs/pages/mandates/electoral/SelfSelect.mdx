# SelfSelect

SelfSelect is an electoral mandate that allows users to freely claim a specific role. This is useful for open membership organizations or for onboarding users to a "Member" role.

## Overview

This mandate provides a permissionless entry point into a role. Any account can call this mandate to assign the configured role to themselves, provided they do not already hold it. It is the simplest form of onboarding.

## Configuration

When adopting a SelfSelect instance, the following parameter is required:

1.  `RoleId` (uint256): The role ID that users can claim.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

This mandate does not require any input parameters. When called, it attempts to assign the role to the caller.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Validation**
    *   Checks if the caller already holds the configured `RoleId`.
    *   If the caller already has the role, the transaction reverts to prevent redundant assignments.

2.  **Assignment**
    *   If the check passes, the mandate generates an `assignRole` call targeting the caller and the `RoleId`.
    *   The role is immediately assigned.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(
    uint16 index,
    string memory nameDescription,
    bytes memory inputParams,
    bytes memory config
) public override
```
-   Initializes the target role ID.
-   Sets input parameters to empty.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public view override returns (...)
```
-   Validates the user's current status.
-   Returns the assignment call.

### Error Conditions

1.  **Validation Errors**
    *   "Account already has role.": The caller is already a member of the role.
