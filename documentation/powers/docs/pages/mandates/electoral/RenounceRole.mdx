# RenounceRole

RenounceRole is an electoral mandate that allows users to voluntarily resign from specific roles they currently hold.

## Overview

This mandate provides a mechanism for self-revocation. It is useful for roles where members should be able to leave at will (e.g., opting out of a committee or resigning from a position) without needing an external authority to process the removal. The mandate is configured with a whitelist of roles that can be renounced.

## Configuration

When adopting a RenounceRole instance, the following parameter is required:

1.  `allowedRoleIds` (uint256[]): An array of role IDs that this mandate is authorized to process. Users can only renounce roles included in this list.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, one parameter must be provided:

1.  `roleId` (uint256): The specific role ID the caller wishes to renounce.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Validation**
    *   **Ownership Check:** Verifies that the caller currently holds the specified `roleId` in the Powers contract.
    *   **Permission Check:** Verifies that the `roleId` is present in the `allowedRoleIds` configuration list.

2.  **Revocation**
    *   If checks pass, the mandate generates a `revokeRole` call targeting the caller and the specified role.
    *   The role is immediately revoked upon execution.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(
    uint16 index,
    string memory nameDescription,
    bytes memory inputParams,
    bytes memory config
) public override
```
-   Initializes the allowed role IDs.
-   Sets input parameters to `(uint256 roleId)`.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public view virtual override returns (...)
```
-   Performs ownership and permission checks.
-   Returns the revocation call.

### Error Conditions

1.  **Validation Errors**
    *   "Account does not have role.": The caller is trying to renounce a role they don't hold.
