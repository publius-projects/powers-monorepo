# RevokeAccountsRoleId

RevokeAccountsRoleId is an electoral mandate that revokes a specific role from **all** accounts that currently hold it.

## Overview

This mandate acts as a "reset button" or a dissolution mechanism for a specific role. When executed, it iterates through every account that holds the configured role and revokes it. This is useful for:
*   Dissolving a committee or working group.
*   Resetting role assignments before a new election cycle.
*   Emergency revocation of a compromised group.

## Configuration

When adopting a RevokeAccountsRoleId instance, the following parameters are required:

1.  `RoleId` (uint256): The role ID that will be revoked from all holders.
2.  `InputParams` (string[]): An array of strings defining the input parameters for the mandate (e.g., `["string Reason"]`).
    *   These parameters are displayed in the UI to prompt the caller for information (like a reason for the reset).
    *   The values provided by the caller are included in the action data (and hash) but are not used in the execution logic itself. They serve as an on-chain record of the context.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, the inputs depend on the `InputParams` configuration.
*   If `InputParams` is empty, no arguments are needed.
*   If `InputParams` is set (e.g., `["string Reason"]`), the caller must provide the corresponding values.

### Execution Flow

1.  **State Retrieval**
    *   Queries the Powers contract to get the total count of accounts holding the target `RoleId`.
    *   Retrieves the address of every current role holder.

2.  **Revocation**
    *   Iterates through the list of role holders.
    *   Generates a `revokeRole` call for each account.
    *   Returns the batch of revocation calls for execution.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(
    uint16 index,
    string memory nameDescription,
    bytes memory inputParams,
    bytes memory config
) public override
```
-   Initializes the target role ID.
-   Sets the `inputParams` for the UI based on the configuration.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public view override returns (...)
```
-   Fetches all role holders.
-   Constructs the batch revocation logic.

### Error Conditions

1.  **No Action**
    *   If there are no current holders of the role, the mandate returns empty arrays (no execution actions), effectively doing nothing but recording the call.
