# ElectionList_Vote

ElectionList_Vote is an integration mandate that allows users to cast votes in a specific election instance.

## Overview

This mandate is typically deployed dynamically (via `ElectionList_CreateVoteMandate`) for each new election. It serves as the interface for casting votes. By encapsulating the voting logic in a separate mandate, the system can enforce specific access controls (e.g., only `voterRoleId` can call it) and parameters (e.g., `maxVotes`) unique to that election event.

## Configuration

When adopting an ElectionList_Vote instance, the following parameters are required:

1.  `ElectionListContract` (address): The address of the ElectionList helper contract.
2.  `maxVotes` (uint256): The maximum number of nominees a voter can select in a single ballot.
3.  `electionId` (uint256): The unique identifier of the election this mandate is bound to.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, one parameter must be provided:

1.  `vote` (bool[]): An array of booleans corresponding to the list of nominees in the election.
    *   `true`: Vote for this nominee.
    *   `false`: Do not vote for this nominee.

The length of the array must exactly match the number of nominees in the election.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Validation**
    *   Checks if the election is still open.
    *   Verifies that the `vote` array length matches the nominee count.
    *   Counts the number of `true` votes and ensures it does not exceed `maxVotes`.

2.  **Cast Vote**
    *   Calls `vote(electionId, caller, vote)` on the `ElectionList` contract.
    *   The `ElectionList` contract handles the recording of votes and prevention of double-voting.
