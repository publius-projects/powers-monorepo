# ElectionList_CreateVoteMandate

ElectionList_CreateVoteMandate is an integration mandate that initiates a new election by deploying a dedicated "Vote Mandate".

## Overview

In the PowerLabs election system, voting rights and logic are encapsulated in a temporary mandate (an instance of `ElectionList_Vote`). This mandate factory handles the creation of these instances. When executed, it:
1.  Calculates a unique ID for the new election based on the proposal details.
2.  Deploys/Adopts a new `ElectionList_Vote` mandate configured for that specific election.
3.  Configures the new mandate to be accessible only by a specific `voterRoleId`.

This separation ensures that each election is isolated and access-controlled.

## Configuration

When adopting an ElectionList_CreateVoteMandate instance, the following parameters are required:

1.  `ElectionList` (address): The address of the ElectionList helper contract.
2.  `ElectionList_Vote` (address): The address of the `ElectionList_Vote` mandate implementation (used as a template).
3.  `maxVotes` (uint256): The maximum number of votes a voter can cast in the spawned elections.
4.  `voterRoleId` (uint256): The role ID that will be granted permission to call (vote in) the spawned mandate.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, three parameters must be provided to define the election:

1.  `Title` (string): A descriptive title for the election.
2.  `StartBlock` (uint48): The block number when the election starts.
3.  `EndBlock` (uint48): The block number when the election ends.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Initialization**
    *   Computes a unique `electionId` hash from the inputs and the Powers address.
    *   Prepares the initialization data (`MandateInitData`) for a new `ElectionList_Vote` mandate.
    *   Sets the configuration of the new mandate to point to the correct `ElectionList` and `electionId`.
    *   Sets the `allowedRole` condition of the new mandate to the configured `voterRoleId`.

2.  **Adoption**
    *   Generates a call to `IPowers.adoptMandate` to install the new vote mandate.
    *   Returns the adoption call for execution.

## Technical Specifications

### Functions

#### `initializeMandate`
```solidity
function initializeMandate(...) public override
```
-   Initializes the factory configuration.
-   Sets input parameters to `(string Title, uint48 StartBlock, uint48 EndBlock)`.

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(...) public view override returns (...)
```
-   Constructs the `MandateInitData` for the new vote mandate.
-   Encodes the adoption call.
