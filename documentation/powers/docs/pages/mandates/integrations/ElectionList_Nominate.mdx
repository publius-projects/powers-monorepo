# ElectionList_Nominate

ElectionList_Nominate is an integration mandate that allows users to self-nominate (or withdraw) from a specific election managed by the ElectionList contract.

## Overview

This mandate acts as the registration booth for an election. It interacts with the `ElectionList` helper contract to add or remove candidates. Unlike the generic `Nominate` mandate (which operates on a global or single-purpose Nominees list), this mandate is aware of specific election instances identified by their parameters.

Usually, two separate instances of this mandate are deployed for an election system:
1.  One configured to **Nominate** (shouldNominate = true).
2.  One configured to **Revoke Nomination** (shouldNominate = false).

## Configuration

When adopting an ElectionList_Nominate instance, the following parameters are required:

1.  `ElectionList` (address): The address of the ElectionList helper contract.
2.  `shouldNominate` (bool): The mode of operation.
    *   `true`: The mandate will nominate the caller.
    *   `false`: The mandate will revoke the caller's nomination.

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the mandate, the inputs must identify the specific election:

1.  `Title` (string): The title of the election.
2.  `StartBlock` (uint48): The start block of the election.
3.  `EndBlock` (uint48): The end block of the election.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Identification**
    *   Computes the unique `electionId` hash from the inputs and the Powers address.

2.  **Action**
    *   **Nominate Mode:** Calls `nominate(electionId, caller)` on the ElectionList contract.
    *   **Revoke Mode:** Calls `revokeNomination(electionId, caller)` on the ElectionList contract.
